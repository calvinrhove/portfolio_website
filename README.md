About:

This is the initial state of my portfolio project for the NuCamp Devops course. It contains all of the resources used in my website, a dockerfile to automatically run requirements to install all dependencies, and the app.py file to manage to core http get requests behind the website

This project is overall a bit simpler than I initially had in mind, but still fufills the goals of a hosted flask project and dockerfile. Originally I'd wanted to add an SQL database that would allow users to "Sign off" on a digital whiteboard, marking their name on the website as a visitor, however my files somehow corrupted and that aspect proved too difficult for the time available, so I focused instead on developing a workable product

Additional future considerations are to revise the HTML and CSS to apply to all resolutions better, and add a more fluent feel to the website via CSS

For testing, I elected to go for a simple binary test just to set up the folder structure. Any other tests felt unnecessary for the scope of the application
